### 🚀 Projects & Contributions

-   **Multi-Drone Composition, UAV Tracking, and Instance Segmentation**
    -   A research project at the Indian Institute of Technology Tirupati, where I'm currently an intern.
    -   Developed techniques for UAV tracking and composition using YOLO and U2-Net models.
    -   Optimized multi-object tracking with advanced algorithms such as BOTSORT, DeepOCSort, and ByteTrack.
    -   **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, SORT Algorithms.
-   **Vibes COMMUNICATION Freelance Project**
    -   Developed a Flutter application (user and admin versions) to track employee attendance, pay, and car information.
    -   The app automated several processes and utilized a Google Sheet as the database, which lowered their labor effort.
-   **aiRis: Elevating Conversations, One Voice at a Time**
    -   An Android VoiceBot for real-time, emotionally intelligent conversations.
    -   Achieved high transcription accuracy for Indian English accents using `faster-whisper` and fine-tuned `LLAMA 3.2` for context-aware responses.
    -   **Technologies:** Python, Whisper, LLAMA, Pyttsx3.
-   **Open Source Contribution: BoxMOT - Issue #2022**
    -   Reported and suggested a fix for a multiprocessing error with CUDA, which was later resolved and included in release [v13.0.7](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/boxmot/releases/tag/v13.0.7).
    -   This contribution was a part of my AI Research Internship at **IIT Tirupati**.
